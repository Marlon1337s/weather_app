This is an Weather App!

Your one-stop app for accurate weather updates. Enter a city name to get real-time weather data for your location.

**How it Works:**
1. Enter the **city name** (e.g., "New York").
2. The app uses the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch the latest weather information.

**Important Notes:**
- City names aren't case-insensitive, but ensure correct spelling (e.g., "london" works as well as "London").
